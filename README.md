littlescripts
=============

A repository where I put all the garbage scripts I made


## luckyguess.rb

A script to generate random bitcoin private / public keypair, request a block explorer API (here blockr.io) and send a mail if balance is positive, so you can steal BTC.
Obviously wouldn't work because there's too much possible BTC keypairs (10^48) but still fun to try.

Requirements : vanitygen
